np 3d array, rotate x,... wont work, unless only passed x col


after blocks, creat cube, then creat object that can be moved

cubesize n

cume(n**3).resabe(n,n,n)

convert n of any size to 3x3 then solve, check for parity
do on cube, then print list

can mover cube or input list of moves to scram

def rand cube shuffewl for person or com

show move scrabme, time

do scrable live




--------------------------------------
::::bomb::::

ai
give borders and pos, open
either creat alg or nn

event
get mous pos on click
        find x_y pos devide by size to find index
        click bom in pos.....

baybe save so ghrid isnt np array with ones, zers but bombs

maybe set already then asign active after

# def mine_local():
#     # minise where np random = 1
#     mine_cnt = int(0.2 * map_grid.size[0]*map_grid.size[1])
#     # for m in range(mine_cnt):
#     #     mine_sp.add(mi)

# squared since 2,2
# maybe count not prob
# no more than 4'
# gen boms on first click if no bombs, open area
# prob = 0.2
# map_grid = np.random.choice(1, tiles ** 2, p=[1-prob, prob]).reshape((tiles, tiles))
